## PRIMES IS IN P ##

The **AKS primality test** (also known as *Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena primality test* and *cyclotomic AKS test*) is a deterministic primality-proving algorithm created and published by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena, computer scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, on August 6, 2002, in an article titled [PRIMES is in P](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/algebra/primality_v6.pdf).

The AKS primality test is based upon the following theorem: 

Given an integer $n \geq 2$ and integer $a$ coprime to $n$, $n$ is prime if and only if the polynomial congruence relation

  $$(X+a)^{n}\equiv X^{n}+a{\pmod {n}}$$

holds within the polynomial ring $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})[X]$.
